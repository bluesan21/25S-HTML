I have completed the HTML/CSS/JS project as assigned. Since I had trouble accessing the LAMP/FTP server, I have uploaded my full project to GitHub for your review.
This project contains a fully responsive retro-themed micro-site dedicated to the Nintendo Game Boy. It consists of seven HTML pages, each highlighting different aspects of the product, including its history, various models (Classic, Pocket, Color), technical specifications, and a product showcase section. The site is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”without the use of any external libraries or frameworks. All components, including the header and footer, are dynamically rendered using vanilla JavaScript. The layout is designed to be mobile-friendly and visually consistent across different screen sizes.
