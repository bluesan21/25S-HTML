I have completed the assigned HTML/CSS/JavaScript project. Due to difficulties accessing the LAMP/FTP server, I have uploaded the full project to GitHub for your review.

This project is a fully responsive retro-themed micro-site dedicated to the Nintendo Game Boy. It comprises seven HTML pages, each presenting different aspects of the product, including its history, various models (Classic, Pocket, Color), technical specifications, and a product showcase section.

The site is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks. All components, including the header and footer, are dynamically rendered using vanilla JavaScript. The layout is optimized for mobile devices and maintains visual consistency across various screen sizes.
